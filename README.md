This is a working repo for Yunyi's ecological modeling idea: Repeated Sampling Zero Inflated Generalized Additive Models. The idea is when there exist imperfect detection of the data, say counting number of birds, meanwhile, not all spots are occupied by certain birds, which cause zero inflate, we need to model theses factors at the same time.

The main function will follow R package [COZIGAM](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v035i11/0), by adding one more EM step to the main distribution (or somehow follow N-mixture models), to deal with the imperfect detection (count).
